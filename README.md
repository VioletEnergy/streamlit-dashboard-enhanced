The school learning modalities Dashboard is designed to look at how students experienced hybrid, in-person, and remote learning during the 2020-2021 school year. Using data from the NCES, this dashboard provides clear insights into the shifts in learning methods during the pandemic.

## Some key features the dashboard offers: 
- Visualizaton of trends: See how the number of students in each learning modality changed week by week with easy-to-read charts.
- Explore Data: Use filters to focus on specific districts or learning types, making the data relevant to your interests.
- Quick Insights: Instantly view key statistics, like total student counts, the number of districts represented, and weekly averages.

## Reflection:
At the start, I found it challenging to fork and copy the original repository, but with some persistence, I was able to figure it out. The biggest hurdle for me was setting up the code to generate the graphs, as it required a bit of trial and error to get everything working correctly. While I initially wanted to use a different dataset, I struggled to find one that truly interested me. Ultimately, I decided to work with the provided dataset, and Iâ€™m glad I did. Seeing the data come to life in Streamlit was a rewarding experience, and it gave me a sense of accomplishment as I brought the dashboard together.
